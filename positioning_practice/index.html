		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>So You Think You Can Dance is an American dance competition show. The twelfth season returned on Monday, June 1, 2015. The show was aired every Monday at 8:00PM eastern time.</p>

		<p>Auditions were held in Dallas, Texas; Detroit, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; Memphis, Tennessee; and New York, New York.</p>

		<p>This season on SYTYCD there was a complete shift in the competition format. Dancers auditioned to be on the stage team or the street team. The stage team included styles such as: ballet, contemporary, tao, jazz, and latin. The street team included styles such as: freestyle, hip-hop, and krump. The top 20 finalist were made up of 10 stage dancers and 10 street dancers.</p>

		<p>Each week the bottom three stage and street dancers were selected. The public had the chance to save their favorite street and stage dancer in the bottom by live tweeting who they wanted to save. The dancer witht the most tweets was saved and the judges would save one more street and stage dance. Once the competition reacher top 10 they were eleminated only on the votes from the public.</p>

		<p>Voting took place by going onto <a id="link" href="http://www.fox.com">fox.com</a>, using the Fox Now App to super vote, or by SMS.</p>

		<p>This years winner was Gaby Diaz from Miami, FL. She auditioned twice this season as a tap dancer and got a ticket to Vegas after her second audition. Her versatality won over the judges and America, landing her a spot as a dancer in J. Lo's Vegas show.</p>
